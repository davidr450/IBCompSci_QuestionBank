# IBCompSci_QuestionBank
A exam question bank for IB Computer Science teachers

Arising from a discussion on the IB Computer Science Techers Facebook page, we have decided to develop a exam question bank for IB Computer Science questions. The idea is that the questions can be crowd-sourced across Computer Science teachers (with model solutions), while tests and exams can be downloaded easily and quickly.
Initial plans include:
* Login System (includes school information, logo, etc for exam creation)
* SSO (Facebook / Google / Office365)
* Question Submission (with topic, paper-type, Section type)
* Question editing
* Exam creation (with School info, date, etc - producing persistent PDF and editable document files with exam and markscheme.)
* Audit Trails

Future plans may include:
* To be discussed

Coding Principles
* OOP PHP
* Github

Technologies: 
* LAMP
* jQuery/AJAX
* Bootstrap

Costs / Ownership:
* David Russell (Owner) will host the product
* All images, etc will be paid stock photos, or developed for this project by members of the project, and donated to the project. Ownership of all images is assumed to be vested in the project.

Open Discussions:
* How do we verify users as legitimate users? How do we restrict access to only IB Computer Science teachers?
* Is there any value in a separate mobile app?
